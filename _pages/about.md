I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University.

My current research interest focuses on the open macroeconomics, especially the transitional growth patterns of emerging market economies in the open-economy scenario.

Before the Ph.D. career, I studied Economics and Finance at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University.
