+ **Abstract**: Data contributes to economic growth directly by acting as a factor and indirectly by enhancing knowledge accumulation for innovation. However, the potential constraint by data storage might limit data-driven endogenous growth. This paper develops an endogenous growth model in which data accumulation is constrained by the economy's data storage capacity. In the model, the data stock can be used repeatedly, but it must be stored in data storage, both of which are distinct from the existing literature on data-driven growth. Data thus has a higher marginal cost, exceeding the compensation for privacy concerns, and rivalry of data storage partially impairs the nonrivalry of data. The data storage constraint only cramps growth when the efficiency of data storage construction is relatively low. When this constraint is present, the economy suffers slower growth and lower consumption share away from the ideal level. Higher data intensity of innovation, if not assisted by adequate improvement in the efficiency of data storage construction, might impede economic growth in contrast due to the more stringent data storage constraint. This provides an explanation for the Solow Paradox of why intensification of information technology is sometimes not observed in the productivity statistics.
